# 💬 Message-as-a-Service (MaaS)

**One app to message, send money, share files, and trigger actions — all from a single chat interface.**

---

## 📦 Overview

Message-as-a-Service is a next-generation communication app that transforms chat into a central interface for taking action. From sending money and transferring files to scheduling calendar events and booking services, this platform turns your conversations into powerful workflows.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 💸 **Send Money in Chat** — Peer-to-peer or business transactions via chat messages
- 📁 **File Sharing** — Share PDFs, docs, images, and media directly through messages
- 📅 **Smart Actions** — Book a ride, add calendar events, make payments using chat commands
- 🔌 **Plugin Architecture** — Payments, rides, events, media, and custom integrations
- 🔐 **End-to-End Encryption** — Messages, media, and transaction metadata secured
- 🧠 **Conversational AI** — Smart parsing of commands and contextual interactions

## 💡 Why It Works

Everyone already uses chat. Instead of switching apps, **enable everything from one conversation** — more intuitive, faster, and action-oriented.

### 🔌 Plugin System

Plugins are small, pluggable micro-apps that execute based on chat input. Examples:

```plaintext
"Send $10 to @james" → Triggers `PaymentPlugin`
"Book me a ride to the airport" → Triggers `RidePlugin`
"Schedule call with Anna tomorrow at 3pm" → Triggers `CalendarPlugin`
```

### 🔐 Security Model

- End-to-end encrypted chats (AES-256)
- Plugin authorization scope per user (OAuth2 tokens)
- Secure vault for payments and API credentials
- Role-based permission control for sensitive actions
